## Intro
Configuration is done via a single YAML file and a server restart is required in order for any changes to take effect. Trying to start the server with an invalid config file will result in an error.

## Preconfigured page
If you don't want to spend time reading through all the available configuration options and just want something to get you going quickly you can use the following `glance.yml` and make changes as you see fit:

```yaml
pages:
  - name: Home
    columns:
      - size: small
        widgets:
          - type: calendar

          - type: rss
            limit: 10
            collapse-after: 3
            cache: 3h
            feeds:

      - size: small
        widgets:
          - type: weather
            location: London, United Kingdom

          - type: markets
            markets:
              - symbol: SPY
                name: S&P 500
              - symbol: BTC-USD
                name: Bitcoin
              - symbol: NVDA
                name: NVIDIA
              - symbol: AAPL
                name: Apple
              - symbol: MSFT
                name: Microsoft
              - symbol: GOOGL
                name: Google
              - symbol: AMD
                name: AMD
              - symbol: RDDT
                name: Reddit
```

This will give you a page that looks like the following:

![](images/preconfigured-page-preview.png)

Configure the widgets, add more of them, add extra pages, etc. Make it your own!

## Server
Server configuration is done through a top level `server` property. Example:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  assets-path: /home/user/glance-assets
```

### Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Default |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| host | string | no |  |
| port | number | no | 8080 |
| assets-path | string | no |  |

#### `host`
The address which the server will listen on. Setting it to `localhost` means that only the machine that the server is running on will be able to access the dashboard. By default it will listen on all interfaces.

#### `port`
A number between 1 and 65,535, so long as that port isn't already used by anything else.

#### `assets-path`
The path to a directory that will be served by the server under the `/assets/` path. This is handy for widgets like the Monitor where you have to specify an icon URL and you want to self host all the icons rather than pointing to an external source.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When installing through docker the path will point to the files inside the container. Don't forget to mount your assets path to the same path inside the container.
> Example:
>
> If your assets are in:
> ```
> /home/user/glance-assets
> ```
>
> You should mount:
> ```
> /home/user/glance-assets:/app/assets
> ```
>
> And your config should contain:
> ```
> assets-path: /app/assets
> ```

##### Examples

Say you have a directory `glance-assets` with a file `gitea-icon.png` in it and you specify your assets path like:

```yaml
assets-path: /home/user/glance-assets
```

To be able to point to an asset from your assets path, use the `/assets/` path like such:

```yaml
icon: /assets/gitea-icon.png
```

## Theme
Theming is done through a top level `theme` property. Values for the colors are in [HSL](https://giggster.com/guide/basics/hue-saturation-lightness/) (hue, saturation, lightness) format. You can use a color picker [like this one](https://hslpicker.com/) to convert colors from other formats to HSL. The values are separated by a space and `%` is not required for any of the numbers.

Example:

```yaml
theme:
  background-color: 100 20 10
  primary-color: 40 90 40
  contrast-multiplier: 1.1
```

### Themes
If you don't want to spend time configuring your own theme, there are [several available themes](themes.md) which you can simply copy the values for.

### Properties
| Name | Type | Required | Default |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| light | boolean | no | false |
| background-color | HSL | no | 240 8 9 |
| primary-color | HSL | no | 43 50 70 |
| positive-color | HSL | no | same as `primary-color` |
| negative-color | HSL | no | 0 70 70 |
| contrast-multiplier | number | no | 1 |
| text-saturation-multiplier | number | no | 1 |
| custom-css-file | string | no | |

#### `light`
Whether the scheme is light or dark. This does not change the background color, it inverts the text colors so that they look appropriately on a light background.

#### `background-color`
Color of the page and widgets.

#### `primary-color`
Color used across the page, largely to indicate unvisited links.

#### `positive-color`
Used to indicate that something is positive, such as stock price being up, twitch channel being live or a monitored site being online. If not set, the value of `primary-color` will be used.

#### `negative-color`
Oppposite of `positive-color`.

#### `contrast-multiplier`
Used to increase or decrease the contrast (in other words visibility) of the text. A value of `1.3` means that the text will be 30% lighter/darker depending on the scheme. Use this if you think that some of the text on the page is too dark and hard to read. Example:

![difference between 1 and 1.3 contrast](images/contrast-multiplier-example.png)

#### `text-saturation-multiplier`
Used to increase or decrease the saturation of text, useful when using a custom background color with a high amount of saturation and needing the text to have a more neutral color. `0.5` means that the saturation will be 50% lower and `1.5` means that it'll be 50% higher.

#### `custom-css-file`
Path to a custom CSS file, either external or one from within the server configured assets path. Example:

```yaml
theme:
  custom-css-file: /assets/my-style.css
```

> [!TIP]
>
> Because Glance uses a lot of utility classes it might be difficult to target some elements. To make it easier to style specific widgets, each widget has a `widget-type-{name}` class, so for example if you wanted to make the links inside just the RSS widget bigger you could use the following selector:
>
> ```css
> .widget-type-rss a {
>     font-size: 1.5rem;
> }


## Pages & Columns
![illustration of pages and columns](images/pages-and-columns-illustration.png)

Using pages and columns is how widgets are organized. Each page contains up to 3 columns and each column can have any number of widgets.

### Pages
Pages are defined through a top level `pages` property. The page defined first becomes the home page and all pages get automatically added to the navigation bar in the order that they were defined. Example:

```yaml
pages:
  - name: Home
    columns: ...

  - name: Videos
    columns: ...

  - name: Homelab
    columns: ...
```

### Properties
| Name | Type | Required | Default |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| title | string | yes | |
| slug | string | no | |
| show-mobile-header | boolean | no | false |
| columns | array | yes | |

#### `title`
The name of the page which gets shown in the navigation bar.

#### `slug`
The URL friendly version of the title which is used to access the page. For example if the title of the page is "RSS Feeds" you can make the page accessible via `localhost:8080/feeds` by setting the slug to `feeds`. If not defined, it will automatically be generated from the title.

#### `show-mobile-header`
Whether to show a header displaying the name of the page on mobile. The header purposefully has a lot of vertical whitespace in order to push the content down and make it easier to reach on tall devices.

Preview:

![](images/mobile-header-preview.png)

### Columns
Columns are defined for each page using a `columns` property. There are two types of columns - `full` and `small`, which refers to their width. A small column takes up a fixed amount of width (300px) and a full column takes up the all of the remaining width. You can have up to 3 columns per page and you must have either 1 or 2 full columns. Example:

```yaml
pages:
  - name: Home
    columns:
      - size: small
        widgets: ...
      - size: full
        widgets: ...
      - size: small
        widgets: ...
```

### Properties
| Name | Type | Required |
| ---- | ---- | -------- |
| size | string | yes |
| widgets | array | no |

Here are some of the possible column configurations:

![column configuration small-full-small](images/column-configuration-1.png)

```yaml
columns:
  - size: small
    widgets: ...
  - size: full
    widgets: ...
  - size: small
    widgets: ...
```

![column configuration small-full-small](images/column-configuration-2.png)

```yaml
columns:
  - size: full
    widgets: ...
  - size: small
    widgets: ...
```

![column configuration small-full-small](images/column-configuration-3.png)

```yaml
columns:
  - size: full
    widgets: ...
  - size: full
    widgets: ...
```

## Widgets
Widgets are defined for each column using a `widgets` property. Example:

```yaml
pages:
  - name: Home
    columns:
      - size: small
        widgets:
          - type: weather
            location: London, United Kingdom
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Currently not all widgets are designed to fit every column size, however some widgets offer different "styles" that help alleviate this limitation.

### Shared Properties
| Name | Type | Required |
| ---- | ---- | -------- |
| type | string | yes |
| title | string | no |
| cache | string | no |

#### `type`
Used to specify the widget.

#### `title`
The title of the widget. If left blank it will be defined by the widget.

#### `cache`
How long to keep the fetched data in memory. The value is a string and must be a number followed by one of s, m, h, d. Examples:

```yaml
cache: 30s # 30 seconds
cache: 5m  # 5 minutes
cache: 2h  # 2 hours
cache: 1d  # 1 day
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Not all widgets can have their cache duration modified. The calendar and weather widgets update on the hour and this cannot be changed.

### RSS

### Reddit
Display a list of posts from a specific subreddit.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Reddit does not allow unauthorized API access from VPS IPs, if you're hosting Glance on a VPS you will get a 403 response. As a workaround you can route the traffic from Glance through a VPN or your own HTTP proxy using the `request-url-template` property.

Example:

```yaml
- type: reddit
  subreddit: technology
```

#### Properties

![](images/reddit-widget-vertical-list-thumbnails.png)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Thumbnails don't work for some subreddits due to Reddit's API not returning the thumbnail URL. No workaround for this yet.

##### `limit`
The maximum number of posts to show.

##### `collapse-after`
How many posts are visible before the "SHOW MORE" button appears. Set to `-1` to never collapse. Not available when using the `vertical-cards` and `horizontal-cards` styles.

##### `comments-url-template`
Used to replace the default link for post comments. Useful if you want to use the old Reddit design or any other 3rd party front-end. Example:

```yaml
comments-url-template: https://old.reddit.com/{POST-PATH}
```

Placeholders:

`{POST-PATH}` - the full path to the post, such as:

```
r/selfhosted/comments/bsp01i/welcome_to_rselfhosted_please_read_this_first/
```

`{POST-ID}` - the ID that comes after `/comments/`

`{SUBREDDIT}` - the subreddit name

##### `request-url-template`
A custom request url that will be used to fetch the data instead. This is useful when you're hosting Glance on a VPS and Reddit is blocking the requests, and you want to route it through an HTTP proxy.

Placeholders:

`{REQUEST-URL}` - will be templated and replaced with the expanded request URL (i.e. https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/hot.json). Example:

```
https://proxy/{REQUEST-URL}
https://your.proxy/?url={REQUEST-URL}
```

##### `sort-by`
Can be used to specify the order in which the posts should get returned. Possible values are `hot`, `new`, `top` and `rising`.

##### `top-period`
Available only when `sort-by` is set to `top`. Possible values are `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year` and `all`.

##### `search`
Keywords to search for. Searching within specific fields is also possible, **though keep in mind that Reddit may remove the ability to use any of these at any time**:

![](images/reddit-field-search.png)

##### `extra-sort-by`
Can be used to specify an additional sort which will be applied on top of the already sorted posts. By default does not apply any extra sorting and the only available option is `engagement`.

The `engagement` sort tries to place the posts with the most points and comments on top, also prioritizing recent over old posts.

### Search Widget
Display a search bar that can be used to search for specific terms on various search engines.

Example:

```yaml
- type: search
  search-engine: duckduckgo
  bangs:
    - title: YouTube
      shortcut: "!yt"
      url: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query={QUERY}
```

Preview:

![](images/search-widget-preview.png)

#### Keyboard shortcuts
| Keys | Action | Condition |
| ---- | ------ | --------- |
| <kbd>S</kbd> | Focus the search bar | Not already focused on another input field |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Perform search in the same tab | Search input is focused and not empty |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Perform search in a new tab | Search input is focused and not empty |
| <kbd>Escape</kbd> | Leave focus | Search input is focused |

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Required | Default |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| search-engine | string | no | duckduckgo |
| bangs | array | no | |

##### `search-engine`
Either a value from the table below or a URL to a custom search engine. Use `{QUERY}` to indicate where the query value gets placed.

| Name | URL |
| ---- | --- |
| duckduckgo | `https://duckduckgo.com/?q={QUERY}` |
| google | `https://www.google.com/search?q={QUERY}` |

##### `bangs`
What now? [Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs). They're shortcuts that allow you to use the same search box for many different sites. Assuming you have it configured, if for example you start your search input with `!yt` you'd be able to perform a search on YouTube:

![](images/search-widget-bangs-preview.png)

##### Properties for each bang
| Name | Type | Required |
| ---- | ---- | -------- |
| title | string | no |
| shortcut | string | yes |
| url | string | yes |

###### `title`
Optional title that will appear on the right side of the search bar when the query starts with the associated shortcut.

###### `shortcut`
Any value you wish to use as the shortcut for the search engine. It does not have to start with `!`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> In YAML some characters have special meaning when placed in the beginning of a value. If your shortcut starts with `!` (and potentially some other special characters) you'll have to wrap the value in quotes:
> ```yaml
> shortcut: "!yt"
>```

###### `url`
The URL of the search engine. Use `{QUERY}` to indicate where the query value gets placed. Examples:

```yaml
url: https://www.reddit.com/search?q={QUERY}
url: https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term={QUERY}
url: https://www.amazon.com/s?k={QUERY}
```

### Extension
Display a widget provided by an external source (3rd party). If you want to learn more about developing extensions, checkout the [extensions documentation](extensions.md) (WIP).

```yaml
- type: extension
  url: https://domain.com/widget/display-a-message
  allow-potentially-dangerous-html: true
  parameters:
    message: Hello, world!
```

#### Properties

> [!WARNING]
>
> There's a reason this property is scary-sounding. It's intended to be used by developers who are comfortable with developing and using their own extensions. Do not enable it if you have no idea what it means or if you're not **absolutely sure** that the extension URL you're using is safe.

You can hover over the "ERROR" text to view more information.

#### Properties

| Name | Type | Required |
| ---- | ---- | -------- |
| sites | array | yes |
| style | string | no |

##### `style`
To make the widget scale appropriately in a `full` size column, set the style to the experimental `dynamic-columns-experimental` option.

##### `sites`

Properties for each site:

| Name | Type | Required | Default |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| title | string | yes | |
| url | string | yes | |
| icon | string | no | |
| allow-insecure | boolean | no | false |
| same-tab | boolean | no | false |

`title`

The title used to indicate the site.

`url`

The URL which will be requested and its response will determine the status of the site. Optionally, you can specify this using an environment variable with the syntax `${VARIABLE_NAME}`.

`icon`

Optional URL to an image which will be used as the icon for the site. Can be an external URL or internal via [server configured assets](#assets-path). You can also directly use [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) via a `si:` prefix:

```yaml
icon: si:jellyfin
icon: si:gitea
icon: si:adguard
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> Simple Icons are loaded externally and are hosted on `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, if you do not wish to depend on a 3rd party you are free to download the icons individually and host them locally.

`allow-insecure`

Whether to ignore invalid/self-signed certificates.

`same-tab`

Whether to open the link in the same or a new tab.

### Releases
Display a list of releases for specific repositories on Github. Draft releases and prereleases will not be shown.

```

Preview:

![](images/releases-widget-preview.png)

#### Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Default |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| repositories | array | yes |  |
| token | string | no | |
| limit | integer | no | 10 |
| collapse-after | integer | no | 5 |

##### `repositories`
A list of repositores for which to fetch the latest release for. Only the name/repo is required, not the full URL.

##### `token`
Without authentication Github allows for up to 60 requests per hour. You can easily exceed this limit and start seeing errors if you're tracking lots of repositories or your cache time is low. To circumvent this you can [create a read only token from your Github account](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) and provide it here.

You can also specify the value for this token through an ENV variable using the syntax `${GITHUB_TOKEN}` where `GITHUB_TOKEN` is the name of the variable that holds the token. If you've installed Glance through docker you can specify the token in your docker-compose:

```yaml
services:
  glance:
    image: glanceapp/glance
    environment:
      - GITHUB_TOKEN: <your token>
```

and then use it in your `glance.yml` like this:

```yaml
- type: releases
  token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
  repositories: ...
```

This way you can safely check your `glance.yml` in version control without exposing the token.

##### `limit`
The maximum number of releases to show.

#### `collapse-after`
How many releases are visible before the "SHOW MORE" button appears. Set to `-1` to never collapse.

##### `repository`
The owner and repository name that will have their information displayed.

##### `token`
Without authentication Github allows for up to 60 requests per hour. You can easily exceed this limit and start seeing errors if your cache time is low or you have many instances of this widget. To circumvent this you can [create a read only token from your Github account](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) and provide it here.

##### `pull-requests-limit`
The maximum number of latest open pull requests to show. Set to `-1` to not show any.
